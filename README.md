## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS

### What I learned

Found out about the background-blend-mode css property and how it can be used to blend an image together with a color to yield amazing results

```css
.picture:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
    background-color: var(--clr-soft-blue);
    background-blend-mode: overlay;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
